<h1>Railway Time Tracking & Prediction System</h1>
<br>
Project Overview<br>
The goal is to create a basic system that can:

Track train details (name, departure city, arrival city, departure time).

Predict the train's arrival time considering possible delays.

Display the predicted arrival time to the user.

This project introduces you to object-oriented programming, datetime manipulation, randomness for simulating delays, and basic input/output in Python.

Key Concepts You Will Learn
Python classes and objects

Handling date and time with the datetime module

Generating random delays with the random module

Basic user input and output

Simple prediction logic to simulate arrival time

Sample Code for a Simple Railway Time Tracking & Arrival Prediction System
python
import datetime
import random

class Train:
    def __init__(self, name, departure_city, arrival_city, departure_time):
        self.name = name
        self.departure_city = departure_city
        self.arrival_city = arrival_city
        self.departure_time = departure_time  # string format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'
        self.delay_minutes = 0

    def predict_arrival(self):
        # Fixed travel time in hours (simplified assumption)
        travel_time_hours = 5

        # Simulate random delay between 0 and 120 minutes
        self.delay_minutes = random.randint(0, 120)

        # Convert departure time string to datetime object
        departure_datetime = datetime.datetime.strptime(self.departure_time, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')

        # Calculate predicted arrival time including delay
        arrival_datetime = departure_datetime + datetime.timedelta(hours=travel_time_hours, minutes=self.delay_minutes)

        return arrival_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')

def main():
    print("Welcome to Railway Time Tracking & Arrival Prediction System\n")

    # Take user input for train details
    train_name = input("Enter train name: ")
    departure_city = input("Enter departure city: ")
    arrival_city = input("Enter arrival city: ")
    departure_time = input("Enter departure time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM): ")

    # Create Train object
    train = Train(train_name, departure_city, arrival_city, departure_time)

    # Predict arrival time
    predicted_arrival = train.predict_arrival()

    # Display results
    print(f"\nTrain '{train.name}' from {train.departure_city} to {train.arrival_city} is predicted to arrive at {predicted_arrival}.")
    print(f"Estimated delay: {train.delay_minutes} minutes.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
How This Works
The Train class stores train information and has a method predict_arrival() that calculates arrival time by adding a fixed travel time plus a random delay.

The main() function collects user inputs, creates a Train object, and prints the predicted arrival time.

The random delay simulates real-world unpredictability in train schedules.

Possible Enhancements for Beginners
Multiple trains: Store and predict arrival times for several trains.

Real distances and speeds: Instead of fixed travel time, calculate based on distance and average speed.

Data storage: Save train data and predictions to a CSV or JSON file.

User interface: Build a simple GUI using Tkinter or a web app with Flask.

Real-time data: Integrate APIs (if available) for live train tracking and update predictions accordingly.

Notifications: Add alerts for delays or early arrivals.
